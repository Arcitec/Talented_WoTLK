# Talented - Kader Edition

This is the same old **Talented** addon but instead of having its modules as separate addons, they are included (_Talented\_GlyphFrame & Talented\_SpecTabs_).

Also, all those separated core files were put into single files depending on the context.

Other than that, nothing was modified except for the glyphs frame that was buggy, now it's working fine and also the code was optimized and cleaned.

## Extra:

Instead of those non-working official sites (_wowhead, wowdb, mmo-champion .. etc_), you can now export/import your templates to/from:

1. EvoWoW.com
2. WoTLKDB.com
3. Altervisa.org
4. TrueWoW.org

Enjoy!
